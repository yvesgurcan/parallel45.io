In an excellent [GDC](https://www.gdconf.com/) talk from 2019 called ["Everyone watching this is fired: Tips for game industry programmers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5HArLYajE), [Mike Acton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeacton/) gave incredibly helpful insight on what he obviously considers the best approach to solve technical problems.

Even if his presentation was geared towards game developers, I found that his advice also worked very well for other fields that involve programming such as web development or even, to some extent, to common life problems. I couldn't resist the urge to apply his 50 tips to [a project I had recently kickstarted](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6667489817640751104) for one of my [clients](/clients).

According to [Mike Acton's standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5HArLYajE&feature=youtu.be&t=1514), I would have indeed been fired. Good thing my clients are more forgiving than him ðŸ˜‰. The part that got me was the one about [the acceptable ranges of the values I am transforming](https://youtu.be/cV5HArLYajE?t=737). Despite using [strongly typed languages and frameworks](/tech), I had not thought deeply enough about input validation and realized that I might have allowed users to enter negative amounts in this invoicing system which, you can imagine, would have screwed up things. Phew, that was close.

I found myself very inspired by the video and decided to templatize (yes, "templatize" is a word, [the Urban Dictionary says so](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=templatize) ðŸ˜›) Mike Acton's tips for my own projects starting now.

As a consequence, I've created a table of 31 questions (see below) that must be answered before starting writing a single line of code on a project at [Parallel45](/about). A very useful tool that is already improving the quality of our work and make our clients even happier!

Thanks, Mike!

And, remember, your project is not future proof nor platform independent! Don't forget to sit and watch actual users of your system to understand the pain points and how they interact with it.
